This is a template for working with Raylib using the MSVC compiler and a simple .bat build file

you can find information about how to use Raylib at

- https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html

and more importantly

-https://www.raylib.com/

There are only 2 dependancies, everything else comes with the repo

- Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio and it's C++ build tools
- Git for your own version control

This project is built through the command line, 
if you do not know how to operate your command prompt this is a good way to learn

The command line used is the MSVC CMD, if you do not know how to find or use it you can:
- Add the folder that the shell.bat is in (misc) to your path (google "Adding things to my path Windows")
- then run shell.bat to setup your environment variables. YOU WILL NEED TO RERUN SHELL EVERY TIME YOU OPEN A NEW CMD

please let me know if you cannot get this too work.
